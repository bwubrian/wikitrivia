<h1>Wikipedia Trivia Bot</h1>

Unlike most trivia bots, this bot does not take questions from a small, repetative trivia question bank.

Instead, trivia is generated from Wikipedia pages.

<h3>Advantages:</h3>

Not repetative, massive array of questions, allows for interesting custom categories

<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>

The quality of the generated trivia questions is not always the best

<h3>Features:</h3>

Multiple-choice

Timed questions

Generate trivia from custom categories such as "food" or "esports"

<h3>Commands:</h3>

n!help for help

n!trivia for trivia of random category

n!trivia [category] for trivia related to category, with [category] being virtually anything not too specific


<em>*Note: By default, no questions will be generated with NSFW content</em>
