<h1>Wikipedia Trivia Bot</h1>

Unlike most trivia bots, this bot does not take questions from a small, repetative trivia question bank.

Instead, trivia is generated from Wikipedia pages.

Advantages:

Not repetative, massive array of questions, allows for interesting custom categories

Disadvantages:

The quality of the generated trivia questions is not always the best

Features:

Multiple-choice

Timed questions

Generate trivia from custom categories such as "food" or "esports"

Commands:

n!help for help

n!trivia for trivia of random category

n!trivia [category] for trivia related to category, with [category] being virtually anything not too specific


*Note: By default, no questions will be generated with NSFW content
