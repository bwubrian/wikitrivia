Wikipedia Trivia Bot
Unlike most trivia bots, this bot does not take questions from a small, repetative trivia question bank.

Instead, trivia is generated from Wikipedia pages.

Advantages
Not repetative, massive array of questions, allows for interesting custom categories

Disadvantages
The quality of the generated trivia questions is not always the best

Features
Multiple-choice

Timed questions

Generate trivia from custom categories such as "food" or "esports"

Commands
n!help for help

n!trivia for trivia of random category

n!trivia [category] for trivia related to category, with [category] being virtually anything not too specific


*Note: By default, no questions will be generated with NSFW content
